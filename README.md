# DLB-Trie-Search-Prediction
This is a variation of a trie that we utilize alongside a dictionary to simulate autocomplete

# INSTRUCTIONS
1.) Compile ac_test then run ac_test
2.) Think of a word and enter the first character and hit enter
3.) Program will output 5 potential autocompletes using the given dictionary and the time in seconds
4.) If correctly predicted, then enter any number like "1" to choose the answer
5.) If not, then enter the next character and repeat
6.) Once word is complete and no search predictions exist, then enter "$" and it will add the word to user_history
7.) If you enter a letter for a word you previously searched, then it will give priority to that word as the top result. 
8.) Lastly, to exit at any point enter "!"
